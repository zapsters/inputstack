# InputStack

### Brief

A frantic, real-time multiplayer game where players must work together to manage an ever-growing stack of tasks. These tasks, or "modules," range from simple math problems to word unscrambles, color pickers, and more, each requiring different types of input like buttons, sliders, and text fields. Think Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, but fully browser-based and playable instantly.

To make multiplayer seamless, I used Google Firebase's real-time database, ensuring that any changes made by one player sync instantly with everyone else in the game. Whether you're collaborating or frantically yelling at your teammates, the game thrives on teamwork and pressure.

### THE ENHANCED BREACH

InputStack started development in Highschool which led to... interesting coding choices. I am reworking this project under the 'enhanced' branch where I am remaking the project an MVC model combined with what I have learned in college so far. Along with restyling the site.
