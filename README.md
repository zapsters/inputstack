# InputStack
Modules will slowly spawn and requires you, and or your friends, to manage multiple modules at once. Modules can be simple math to unscambling a word or even just keeping a slider up. All modules have some form of input such as an input box, a button, or anything else.'

One of my main inspirations for this project was the game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes." I absolutely love the perfect mix of tension, urgency, and collaboration that game has and this project was my take on this type of games. I love accessability and having experiences and projects abailable just at someone's url is super powerful.

Using Google Firebase's realtime database, InputStack is made possible. Multiplayer works by syncing the modules between clients, so one person's change will sync to everyone else in the same game, allowing teamwork, constructive or frantic yelling.
