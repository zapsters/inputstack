## Overview

InputStack is a frantic, real-time multiplayer game where players must work together to manage an ever-growing stack of tasks. These tasks, or "modules," range from simple math problems to word unscrambles, color pickers, and more. Each module requires different types of input, such as buttons, sliders, and text fields.

Inspired by *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes*, InputStack is fully browser-based and instantly playableâ€”no downloads or installations required.

## How It Works

The game is powered by Google Firebase's real-time database, ensuring seamless multiplayer gameplay. Any changes made by one player are instantly reflected for everyone in the game. This real-time synchronization keeps the game dynamic, fostering both collaboration and chaos.

## Features

- **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Work with (or yell at) your teammates as you race against time.
- **Diverse Challenges**: Solve math problems, unscramble words, select colors, and more.
- **Instant Syncing**: Powered by Firebase, all players see updates in real time.
- **No Setup Required**: Play instantly from your browserâ€”no need for downloads.

## How to Play

1. **Join or Create a Game**: Start a new game or join an existing session with friends.
2. **Solve Tasks Together**: Modules appear with different types of input requirements. Work as a team to clear them before the stack overflows.
3. **Stay Ahead of the Stack**: The faster you complete tasks, the longer you survive!
4. **Communicate & Cooperate**: Efficiency is key, but so is clear communication under pressure.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database for instant updates
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
